/**
 * <CODE>ILockTask</CODE> represents the first part of the client-hub handshake
 * <p>
 * This command is presumably used to make sure that only the original DC client (NMDC) would be able to connect to
 * Direct Connect Hubs and Clients. Hubs are not required to check the validity of the returned key, but they must send
 * this command. It is used in the Client-Hub Handshake, the Client-Client Handshake and the ?Hublist Registration. The
 * other party has to authenticate itself using the LockToKey function. Luckily for us, ??? has decrypted the algorithm,
 * so now anyone may create a client for the DC network.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * <i>Syntax:</i>
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * $Lock &lt;lock&gt; Pk=<pk>|
 * </p>
 * &lt;lock&gt; is a sequence of random characters (except (space), $, |, (?more?)), the minimum and maximum length is
 * not known it is not known what the &lt;pk&gt; is for. and some client implementations skip the Pk= part altogether
 * (DC++ can cope with this, presumably NMDC as well) </p>
 * <p>
 * The client never has to send a $Lock to the hub. Clients have to send a $Lock when two clients connect to eachother.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Example lock for DC++-0.242:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * $Lock EXTENDEDPROTOCOLABCABCABCABCABCABC Pk=DCPLUSPLUS0.242ABCABC|
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The "ABCABC" are just fillers.
 * </p>
