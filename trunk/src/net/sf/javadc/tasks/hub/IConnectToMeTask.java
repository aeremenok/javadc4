/**
 * <CODE>IConnectToMeTask</CODE> is called when someone requests to be called by you
 * <p>
 * This command starts the process for a client-client connection initiated by an active mode client. On receiving the
 * client responds by connecting to the IP and port number specified, and from there the client-client protocol takes
 * over.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * $ConnectToMe &lt;remoteNick&gt; &lt;senderIp&gt;:&lt;senderPort&gt;
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example: <br/>
 * $ConnectToMe ThatGuy 83.43.232.34:1412
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Client1 is active and wants to connect to Client2. Client1 sends through the hub, and starts to listen for incomming
 * connection at address Client1ip:Client1port (TCP).
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Client2 has no way of knowing which client wants to connect, he only knows ip:port of Client1.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Extension: <br/>
 * That Client2 has no way of knowing which client wants to connect can be changed if the hub changes <remoteNick>into
 * the nick of the users who wants to initiate the connection. This extension would break old hubs.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Why would this break old hubs? The 'feature' would only be available on new hubs, or hubs which have scripting
 * support to implement this feature. It really shouldn't even break old clients unless for some odd reason it needs the
 * <remoteNick>to be their own. The only thing I can see that is a bit tricky is for the new clients to detect if the
 * hub supports this extention ~Moch
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * This would be a good opportunity to introduce the connection-cookies supported by ADC which allow clients to avoid
 * guessing from which hub a userconnection arises. ~Cologic
 * </P>
