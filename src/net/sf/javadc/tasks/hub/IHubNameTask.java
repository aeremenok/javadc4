/**
 * <CODE>IHubNameTask</CODE> is used to send the name of the hub
 * <p>
 * This command is part of the Client-Hub Handshake today.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Syntax:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * $HubName &lt;hubname&gt;|
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * &lt;hubname&gt; is the name you use for the hub.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Extensions:
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * It can be sent at any time, changing the name of the hub. This variable should only be used as a sort of description
 * of the hub, a topic.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Client1 and Client2 in same hub might have recieved different &lt;hubname&gt;, this can occur in nmdchub. So
 * &lt;hubname&gt; should not be used in a way to identify hubs.
 * </p>
