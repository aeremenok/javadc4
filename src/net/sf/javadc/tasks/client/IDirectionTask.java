/**
 * This command is sent as a response to the Key command, it decides which party gets to download.
 * <p>
 * The $Direction command is a part of the response packet to the $Lock + $MyNick packet.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * $Direction &lt;direction&gt; &lt;anumber&gt;
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * &lt;direction&gt; is either Upload or Download depending on if your client is uploading or downloading.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * &lt;anumber&gt; is a random number, when both clients want to start downloading then one with higher number starts
 * first.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * After the $Direction command we must send the $Key command (still with in the $Direction packet) in response to the
 * other clients lock.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * $Key &lt;key&gt;
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * &lt;key&gt; is generated from the other users &lt;lock&gt; See Appendix A: Converting a Lock into a Key for how to
 * compute the key from the lock.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The users are now connected.
