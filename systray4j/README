------------------------- Note ----------------------------

Release 2.4 came with a new implementation based on JNI,
replacing the previous socket based communication between
the JVM and KDE. However, according to user feedback, this
new implementation is not stable on some systems. As a
workaround, this release contains the old implementation
as an alternative for these systems. To use the old
implementation, remove the libsystray4j.so shared object
from the java.library.path and start the daemon in the
systray4jd directory.

--------------------- Requirements ------------------------

  KDE 3 + JRE >= 1.4 ( 1.3 for systray4jd )

------------------------ Files ----------------------------

  libsystray4j.so:
    Shared object containing the native code for systray
    access on KDE 3. Put it into a directory where Java
    loads dynamic libraries from.
    for example: $(YOUR_JRE)/lib/i386

  systray4j.jar:
    Must be accessible for the Java class loader,
    so make sure it is in your class path.

  example.sh:
    Run the example code.

  COPYING:
    GNU General Public License

---------------------- Directories ------------------------

   doc:
     Contains the documentation for the systray4j package.

   example:
     Contains example code on how to use the SysTray for
     Java API. Read and change it to become familiar with
     the interface.

   icons:
     Contains the icons used by the example application.
     
   systray4jd:
     Contains the systray daemon.

------------------------ Changes --------------------------    
v2.4.1:

  New:
  
    - The KDE release contains the old socket based
      implementation as an alternative.
  
  Fixed:
  
    - Native thread started when isAvailable() was called.
      Now it starts when the first menu is created.
      
-----------------------------------------------------------

v2.4:

  New:
  
    - Unicode support.
    
    - Systray now emulated on unsupported platforms.
    
    - The KDE 3 code now is based on JNI too.
    
-----------------------------------------------------------

v2.3.2:

  New:

    - SysTrayMenuIcon constructor now accepts URL as source
      for the icon to load.

    - The static member SysTrayMenu.dispose() was intro-
      duced as an alternative to System.exit(). It will
      stop all systray4j threads so they won´t keep the
      application alive.

-----------------------------------------------------------

v2.3.1:

  New:

    - Support for extended ASCII characters on win32.

  Fixed:

    - setState() in CheckableMenuItem didn´t work when
      passing true as argument.

-----------------------------------------------------------

v2.3

  New:

    - Checkable menu items.
    - Support for KDE 3.

-----------------------------------------------------------

v2.2.1

  Fixed:

    - Creating a submenu prior to the main menu made -
      at least sometimes - the virtual machine crash.
